# Rust Everything

_rust-everything: My Rust Exploration Playground_

**Blasting off into Rust!**

I'm thrilled to jump into the world of Rust and unlock its power! This repository serves as my personal sandbox for experimenting with Rust concepts, testing out new ideas, and solidifying my understanding as I progress.

**What's Inside:**

This repository harbors a collection of code snippets, mini-projects, and notes encompassing various aspects of Rust programming, including:

Data types and variables  
Control flow  
Functions  

**Learning Resources:**

My Rust journey is guided by these invaluable resources:

The Official Rust Book: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/  
Rustlings: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings  
Rust by Example: https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/  
Rust Playground: https://play.rust-lang.org/  

**_Work in Progress:_**
Ownership and borrowing,
Error handling,
Structs and enums,
Modules and crates,
And much more to come!

This repository is a constant work in progress, evolving alongside my learning journey. Feel free to drop by and witness the ongoing exploration!

That's all for now! I'm excited to share my Rust exploration with you!
